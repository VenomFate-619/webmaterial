I know this is a little late answer,

you can use if and else statements in ejs as follows

<% if (something) { %>
   // Then do some operation
<% } else { %>
   // Then do some operation
<% } %>
But there is another thing I want to emphasize is that if you use the code this way,

<% if (something) { %>
   // Then do some operation
<% } %>
<% else { %>
   // Then do some operation
<% } %>
